# Data Science Life Cycle

1. **Understand Business Requirements**  
   - Define the problem and identify the customer needs.

2. **Data Acquisition**  
   - Collect data through various sources such as ETL processes, SQL databases (DB, data warehouses), log files, Hadoop, or Spark.

3. **Data Preparation**  
   - Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it's ready for analysis.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize the data using plots and graphs.  
   - Perform hypothesis testing and analyze the data through slicing and dicing.

5. **Modeling, Evaluation, & Interpretation**  
   - Build, evaluate, and interpret machine learning models to solve the problem.

6. **Communicate Results**  
   - Present clear and concise results in a one to six-page summary, including insights on how to use the model.

7. **Deployment**  
   - Deploy the model into a production environment.

8. **Real-World Testing**  
   - Conduct A/B testing to assess the model's performance in real-world scenarios.

9. **Customer/Business Buy-In**  
   - Ensure stakeholders understand and support the model's implementation.

10. **Operations**  
    - Monitor and manage the model in production, including retraining when necessary and handling failures.

11. **Optimization**  
    - Continuously improve the model by incorporating more data, adding new features, and optimizing the code.
