# ML & DL Model Functions Repository

This repository contains a collection of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models implemented as reusable functions. It covers key preprocessing steps for ML and DL workflows, along with implementations of popular ML algorithms and DL architectures. The goal is to provide plug-and-play functions for quick experimentation and model building.

## Features
- **Preprocessing functions**: Various preprocessing steps such as scaling, normalization, encoding, etc.
- **ML models**: Common machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), etc.
- **DL models**: Deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer-based models like BERT.
- **Encoders/Decoders**: Sequence-to-sequence models and attention mechanisms.
- **Easy Integration**: Each model is available as a function that can be directly used with minimal configuration.

## Preprocessing Steps
- Feature scaling (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)
- Data normalization
- Categorical encoding (One-Hot, Label Encoding)
- Data splitting (train/test/validation)
- Handling missing values (Imputation strategies)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, LDA)

## Machine Learning Models

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
You can import and use any of the models/functions in your projects. For example:

```python
from models import linear_regression

# Example usage of linear regression
model = linear_regression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

For detailed usage and examples, check the individual model documentation in the `docs/` folder.
