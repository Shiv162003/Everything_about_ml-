### 1. **Engage with Stakeholders**
   - Start by meeting with the key individuals who are involved in or impacted by the project (such as business owners, managers, or decision-makers). The goal here is to understand their needs, challenges, and what they hope to achieve through the data science project.
   - Ask questions like:
     - What specific problem are we trying to solve?
     - What are the main business goals you want to achieve?
     - How would you define success for this project?
   - It’s important to document these goals and objectives clearly.

### 2. **Understand the Business Context**
   - Take time to learn about the business, the industry, and how things work. This could involve understanding the products or services the business offers, who the customers are, and the internal processes that relate to the problem at hand.
   - Talk to domain experts or people who work closely with the area you're focusing on to get deeper insights into how things operate on a day-to-day basis.

### 3. **Clarify the Desired Outcome**
   - Make sure you fully understand what the business expects from the project. Stakeholders may not always be clear on what data science can or cannot do, so your job is to clarify these expectations.
   - Ask detailed questions like:
     - What kind of solution or result are you expecting (e.g., a prediction model, a detailed report, or a dashboard)?
     - How frequently do you want updates or results (e.g., real-time, daily, monthly)?
     - What will be done with the results once we deliver them? Will the business take specific actions based on these results?

### 4. **Convert Business Problems into Data Science Problems**
   - Translate the business problem into a clear, actionable data science problem. For instance, if the business wants to reduce customer churn (the rate at which customers stop using the product), you might frame this as "Build a model that predicts which customers are most likely to stop using the service."
   - Make sure the problem is well-defined and suitable for a data-driven approach.

### 5. **Identify Constraints and Limitations**
   - Ask about any potential limitations that might impact the project. These could include:
     - **Data limitations**: Is the data available to solve the problem? Is it of good quality? Are there gaps in the data?
     - **Time constraints**: Are there specific deadlines for delivering results?
     - **Budget**: What resources are available for this project? Are there cost-related restrictions?
     - **Legal or ethical considerations**: Are there any data privacy regulations or other legal rules (such as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR) that need to be followed?

### 6. **Define How Success Will Be Measured**
   - Work with the business to determine how they will measure the success of the project. This might involve improving certain business outcomes like increasing sales, reducing costs, or improving customer satisfaction.
   - Understand how these measurements are currently tracked, and make sure that the data science project will help improve these specific areas.

### 7. **Determine the Type of Data Science Solution**
   - Based on the business requirements, figure out what kind of data science solution is needed. This could involve:
     - Building a predictive model (e.g., to forecast sales or predict customer behavior).
     - Analyzing data to find patterns (e.g., customer segmentation or market analysis).
     - Creating a visualization or dashboard to help business teams make decisions based on data.
   - Ensure the solution is appropriate to meet the business’s needs and goals.

### 8. **Present the Project Plan**
   - Once you have a clear understanding of the business problem, communicate the plan back to stakeholders. This includes:
     - Summarizing the business problem in simple terms.
     - Explaining the proposed solution (what kind of data science techniques will be used, the expected outcome, etc.).
     - Listing the data and resources required.
     - Outlining the timeline and specific deliverables.
   - This ensures that everyone is on the same page and that expectations are properly aligned.

### 9. **Adapt to Changing Requirements**
   - Stay in close communication with stakeholders throughout the project to address any changes or new insights. Business needs can evolve, so being flexible and adapting your approach will ensure the project stays relevant and effective.
