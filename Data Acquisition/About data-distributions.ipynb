    "# Understanding Data Distributions in Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Data distributions describe the way data points are spread across different values. Knowing the type of distribution your data follows is important for model selection and assumptions about the data. Here, we’ll explore common distributions, how they look, and where they appear in real-world datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Normal Distribution** is one of the most common distributions. It has a bell-shaped curve and is symmetric around the mean. Many natural phenomena, like height, weight, and test scores, tend to follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- **Mean = Median = Mode**.\n",
    "- Symmetric around the mean.\n",
    "- 68% of data falls within 1 standard deviation from the mean.\n",
    "- 95% of data falls within 2 standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
