    "Let's dive into handling **CSV** and **XLSM** (macro-enabled Excel) files in Python, and cover various operations and techniques to load, manipulate, and clean them effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Handling CSV Files in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a very common format to store data. Python’s `pandas` library provides powerful functionality to read and manipulate CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.1 Basic Loading of a CSV File**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load CSV file into a DataFrame\n",
    "df_csv = pd.read_csv('file.csv')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame\n",
    "print(df_csv.head())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.2 Handling Delimiters Other Than Comma**\n",
    "If your file uses a different delimiter (e.g., `;` or `\\t`), you can specify it with the `sep` parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# For tab-delimited files\n",
    "df_tsv = pd.read_csv('file.tsv', sep='\\t')\n",
    "\n",
    "# For semicolon-delimited files\n",
    "df_semicolon = pd.read_csv('file.csv', sep=';')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.3 Dealing with Missing Values**\n",
    "Sometimes CSV files contain missing or NaN values. You can handle them during the read operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Replace missing values with a placeholder during loading\n",
    "df_csv = pd.read_csv('file.csv', na_values=['NA', 'N/A', 'missing'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Drop rows with missing values\n",
    "df_cleaned = df_csv.dropna()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fill missing values with a specific value (e.g., 0 or mean)\n",
    "df_filled = df_csv.fillna(0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.4 Loading Large CSV Files in Chunks**\n",
    "For large files, loading the entire dataset might not be feasible due to memory constraints. You can load it in chunks:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Load CSV in chunks of 1000 rows at a time\n",
    "chunk_size = 1000\n",
    "chunks = pd.read_csv('large_file.csv', chunksize=chunk_size)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Process each chunk (e.g., append them together or process individually)\n",
    "for chunk in chunks:\n",
    "    # Perform operations on each chunk here\n",
    "    print(chunk.head())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.5 Handling Specific Columns or Rows**\n",
    "You can load specific columns or rows, which can be useful when you’re only interested in a portion of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Load specific columns from a CSV\n",
    "df_columns = pd.read_csv('file.csv', usecols=['column1', 'column2'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load only the first N rows\n",
    "df_head = pd.read_csv('file.csv', nrows=100)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.6 Writing Data to CSV**\n",
    "Once you have manipulated your data, you can write it back to a CSV file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Save DataFrame to CSV\n",
    "df_csv.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save DataFrame with a different delimiter\n",
    "df_csv.to_csv('output.csv', sep=';', index=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Handling XLSM Files in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "**XLSM** is an Excel format that supports macros. While `pandas` can’t execute or manipulate Excel macros, it can read the data stored within the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.1 Loading an XLSM File**\n",
    "To handle XLSM files, you’ll need to install the `openpyxl` or `xlrd` library (for reading data), but `pandas` will generally handle this for you. Here’s how to read an XLSM file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load XLSM file into a DataFrame\n",
    "df_xlsm = pd.read_excel('file.xlsm', sheet_name='Sheet1')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the DataFrame\n",
    "print(df_xlsm.head())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t specify a `sheet_name`, it will load the first sheet by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.2 Loading Multiple Sheets from an XLSM File**\n",
    "If your XLSM file has multiple sheets, you can load them all at once into a dictionary of DataFrames:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Load all sheets from an XLSM file\n",
    "df_sheets = pd.read_excel('file.xlsm', sheet_name=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access specific sheets by name\n",
    "df_sheet1 = df_sheets['Sheet1']\n",
    "df_sheet2 = df_sheets['Sheet2']\n",
    "\n",
    "print(df_sheet1.head())\n",
    "print(df_sheet2.head())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.3 Loading Specific Columns from an XLSM File**\n",
    "Similar to CSV, you can specify the columns to load from an XLSM file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Load specific columns from an XLSM sheet\n",
    "df_xlsm_columns = pd.read_excel('file.xlsm', sheet_name='Sheet1', usecols=['A', 'B', 'C'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.4 Handling Merged Cells in Excel**\n",
    "Sometimes Excel sheets have merged cells. If you want to unmerge these cells, you can use `openpyxl` to handle this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from openpyxl import load_workbook\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load workbook with openpyxl\n",
    "wb = load_workbook('file.xlsm')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select a specific sheet\n",
    "sheet = wb['Sheet1']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Unmerge cells in a range\n",
    "sheet.unmerge_cells('A1:B2')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save the updated workbook\n",
    "wb.save('unmerged_file.xlsm')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, `pandas` will automatically fill merged cells with the original value when reading the file into a DataFrame, so often no manual intervention is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.5 Writing Data to XLSM File**\n",
    "You can also write data back to an XLSM file (though writing macros is not supported directly by `pandas`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Write DataFrame to an XLSM file (without macros)\n",
    "df_xlsm.to_excel('output.xlsm', index=False, sheet_name='Sheet1')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If your goal is to preserve macros in an XLSM file, it's recommended to modify the file without affecting macro functionality, or use tools like `openpyxl` or `xlwings` for macro-based manipulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Key Considerations for Both File Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.1 Data Cleaning**\n",
    "Both CSV and XLSM files may require cleaning before analysis, including:\n",
    "- Handling missing data (`dropna`, `fillna`)\n",
    "- Dropping unnecessary columns\n",
    "- Renaming columns for consistency\n",
    "- Handling duplicates\n",
    "- Converting data types (e.g., dates)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Drop columns and rename others\n",
    "df_cleaned = df_csv.drop(columns=['UnwantedColumn']).rename(columns={'OldName': 'NewName'})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert column to datetime\n",
    "df_cleaned['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_cleaned['Date'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Remove duplicate rows\n",
    "df_cleaned = df_cleaned.drop_duplicates()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Handling missing values\n",
    "df_cleaned = df_cleaned.fillna(0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.2 Performance Considerations**\n",
    "- **CSV** files are lightweight but may be slower to process if the dataset is large.\n",
    "- **XLSM** files are more complex and larger in size, especially when macros are included. They may require more memory and processing power.\n",
    "- For very large data processing, use chunking or optimize the data loading by specifying only necessary columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling CSV and XLSM files in Python with `pandas` is straightforward, though XLSM files introduce some complexity due to macros. The flexibility of `pandas` ensures that you can manipulate and clean data efficiently, whether it's a simple CSV or a macro-enabled Excel sheet."
