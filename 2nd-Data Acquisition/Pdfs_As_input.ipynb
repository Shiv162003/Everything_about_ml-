    "In the backend, a PDF file is essentially a binary document that follows a specific structure defined by the PDF specification (ISO 32000). It consists of various objects such as text, images, fonts, and vector graphics. Here's a high-level overview of how the structure of a PDF looks:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **PDF Header:**\n",
    "   - The header defines the PDF version and appears at the very start of the file.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     %PDF-1.7\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Body:**\n",
    "   - The body contains the objects that make up the content of the PDF document.\n",
    "   - These objects can be of various types, such as:\n",
    "     - **Text**: Stored as a sequence of characters, usually in a font object.\n",
    "     - **Images**: Represented as a stream of pixel data (compressed in formats like JPEG, PNG, or DCT).\n",
    "     - **Vector Graphics**: Defined by a series of paths and instructions (like lines, curves, etc.).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Images** in PDFs are typically stored in the form of **streams**. Each image can be compressed (JPEG, CCITT, or Flate) and is represented by its binary pixel data in the PDF.\n",
    "     - In terms of structure, an image stream might look like this in the object section:\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "       3 0 obj\n",
    "       << /Type /XObject\n",
    "          /Subtype /Image\n",
    "          /Width 600\n",
    "          /Height 400\n",
    "          /ColorSpace /DeviceRGB\n",
    "          /BitsPerComponent 8\n",
    "          /Filter /DCTDecode\n",
    "          /Length 123456 >>\n",
    "       stream\n",
    "       (binary data of image)\n",
    "       endstream\n",
    "       endobj\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Cross-Reference Table:**\n",
    "   - This table keeps track of the locations of all the objects within the PDF file.\n",
    "   - It allows quick access to any object in the file.\n",
    "   - The cross-reference table lists the object numbers, their locations (byte offsets), and their status (whether they are in use or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Trailer:**\n",
    "   - The trailer provides important metadata, such as the location of the cross-reference table, the root object, and the size of the document.\n",
    "   - The root object refers to the \"document catalog\" (which links to the pages of the PDF).\n",
    "   - The trailer structure looks like this:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     trailer\n",
    "     << /Size 4\n",
    "        /Root 1 0 R\n",
    "        /Info 2 0 R\n",
    "        /ID [<0123456789ABCDEF> <0123456789ABCDEF>] >>\n",
    "     startxref\n",
    "     4567\n",
    "     %%EOF\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### PDF Object Types:\n",
    "- **Indirect Objects**: These are objects that are referenced multiple times, like fonts or images.\n",
    "- **Stream Objects**: Used for large binary data, like images and font data.\n",
    "- **Dictionaries**: Contain key-value pairs to describe objects like pages, fonts, and metadata.\n",
    "- **Arrays**: Used to represent ordered collections, such as a list of fonts or images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example PDF Image Object:\n",
    "When an image is embedded into a PDF, it's often stored as a stream of binary data. The object that contains the image will define various properties like its size, color space, compression filter, and the actual image data (which could be a compressed JPEG or PNG stream). The binary data for the image is stored directly within the stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of an Image in the PDF:\n",
    "- **Width** and **Height**: Defines the size of the image.\n",
    "- **ColorSpace**: The color model used (e.g., RGB, CMYK).\n",
    "- **BitsPerComponent**: The bit depth of each color component (e.g., 8 bits per pixel).\n",
    "- **Filter**: Defines the compression method used (e.g., /DCTDecode for JPEG).\n",
    "- **Length**: The length of the stream (in bytes).\n",
    "- **Stream**: Contains the binary data of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting it all Together:\n",
    "Hereâ€™s a simplified structure for a PDF containing an image:\n",
    "1. Header: `%PDF-1.7`\n",
    "2. Body:\n",
    "   - Text and images as objects.\n",
    "   - Image as a stream (with properties like width, height, and compression).\n",
    "3. Cross-reference Table: A table with the locations of objects.\n",
    "4. Trailer: Metadata pointing to the root and other important data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, PDFs organize their contents using a hierarchical object model, where objects are referenced, and binary streams (like image data) are included as part of the document structure."

    "### PyMuPDF (fitz) Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**PyMuPDF**, also known as **fitz**, is a powerful Python library for working with PDF files, as well as other formats like ePub, XPS, and images. It provides a wide range of functionalities, including text extraction, manipulation of PDF elements, rendering of pages as images, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Functions and Features of PyMuPDF (fitz)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Opening a PDF Document**\n",
    "   - To open a PDF, you use `fitz.open()`, which returns a `Document` object.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import fitz  # PyMuPDF\n",
    "   doc = fitz.open(\"example.pdf\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extracting Information**\n",
    "   - **Get number of pages**: \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     num_pages = doc.page_count\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Get the title and metadata** of the PDF:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     metadata = doc.metadata\n",
    "     print(metadata)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Page Handling in PyMuPDF**\n",
    "   - Pages are accessed by index (starting at 0). You can get a specific page object using the `load_page()` method.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   page = doc.load_page(0)  # Load the first page (index 0)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Text Extraction**\n",
    "   - You can extract text from a page using the `get_text()` method, which supports multiple formats (plain text, HTML, or XML).\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   text = page.get_text(\"text\")  # Extract plain text\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Extracting Metadata and Information from a Page**\n",
    "   - You can extract the bounding box (size) of the page or the images embedded within a page.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   rect = page.rect  # Page's bounding box\n",
    "   print(rect)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Rendering Pages as Images**\n",
    "   - You can render a PDF page as an image using the `get_pixmap()` method. This is useful when you need to convert PDF pages into images for further processing.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   pix = page.get_pixmap()\n",
    "   pix.save(\"page.png\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - You can specify the **zoom factor** to control the resolution of the image:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   zoom = 2.0  # Double the resolution\n",
    "   mat = fitz.Matrix(zoom, zoom)  # Define a transformation matrix\n",
    "   pix = page.get_pixmap(matrix=mat)\n",
    "   pix.save(\"high_res_page.png\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Extracting Images from a PDF**\n",
    "   - To extract images (such as JPEG or PNG embedded in the PDF), you can use `get_images()`. You would then extract the image data and save it.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   images = page.get_images(full=True)  # Get all images\n",
    "   for img in images:\n",
    "       xref = img[0]  # Image reference\n",
    "       base_image = doc.extract_image(xref)\n",
    "       image_bytes = base_image[\"image\"]  # Image in byte format\n",
    "       with open(f\"image{xref}.png\", \"wb\") as img_file:\n",
    "           img_file.write(image_bytes)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Modifying PDF Pages**\n",
    "   - **Adding text**: You can add custom text to a page using `draw_text()` method.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   page.insert_text((50, 50), \"Hello, PyMuPDF!\", fontsize=12)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Drawing shapes**: You can also draw shapes (rectangles, circles, lines) using `draw_rect()`, `draw_circle()`, etc.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   page.draw_rect(fitz.Rect(50, 50, 150, 150), color=(0, 0, 0))  # Draw a rectangle\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Saving the PDF**\n",
    "   - After modifying a PDF (e.g., adding text or images), you can save the updated version:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   doc.save(\"modified_example.pdf\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with PDF Pages in Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loading Pages**: Pages in a PDF can be loaded by their index (starting from 0). For instance, to load the first page of a document:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  page = doc.load_page(0)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessing Content**:\n",
    "  - **Text**: Extract text from the page:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    text = page.get_text(\"text\")  # Or 'html', 'xml' for other formats\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - **Images**: Extract images as mentioned earlier using `get_images()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Navigating Pages**: You can loop through all the pages of a document:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  for page_num in range(doc.page_count):\n",
    "      page = doc.load_page(page_num)\n",
    "      print(page.get_text())\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rendering a Page as an Image**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  pix = page.get_pixmap()\n",
    "  pix.save(\"page_image.png\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
