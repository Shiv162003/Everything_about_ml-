    "# Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem. It is especially useful for large datasets and is often used for tasks like spam detection, sentiment analysis, and document classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is Naive Bayes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is a **probabilistic classifier** that assumes all features are independent of each other (this is called the **naive assumption**). Despite this simplifying assumption, Naive Bayes performs surprisingly well on many tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayes' Theorem**:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification:\n",
    "- \\(P(A|B)\\): Posterior probability (the probability of class \\(A\\), given evidence \\(B\\)).\n",
    "- \\(P(B|A)\\): Likelihood (the probability of the evidence \\(B\\) given that class \\(A\\) is true).\n",
    "- \\(P(A)\\): Prior probability of class \\(A\\).\n",
    "- \\(P(B)\\): Prior probability of the evidence \\(B\\) (normalizing constant).\n",

    "## 2. Types of Naive Bayes Classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "- **Use when**: The features follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution.\n",
    "- **Example**: Predicting if a patient has a disease based on continuous variables like age, weight, and blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Multinomial Naive Bayes\n",
    "- **Use when**: The features represent discrete counts (e.g., word counts in text).\n",
    "- **Example**: Text classification, document classification (spam detection, sentiment analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Bernoulli Naive Bayes\n",
    "- **Use when**: The features are binary (0/1).\n",
    "- **Example**: Binary text classification (e.g., spam vs. not spam, where features indicate whether a particular word exists in the document).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. When to Use Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Naive Bayes is ideal for**:\n",
    "  - Large datasets.\n",
    "  - Problems with independent features.\n",
    "  - Text classification tasks (spam detection, document categorization).\n",
    "  - When the classes are well-separated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limitations**:\n",
    "  - It assumes feature independence, which may not hold in many real-world problems.\n",
    "  - If a feature has a value that the classifier never saw during training (zero probability), the model will assign a zero probability to the entire prediction. This is known as the **zero-frequency problem**, which can be solved using techniques like **Laplace smoothing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Type of Data Required\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Features**: Can be continuous (for Gaussian Naive Bayes), discrete (for Multinomial Naive Bayes), or binary (for Bernoulli Naive Bayes).\n",
    "- **Target Variable**: Categorical (usually binary or multi-class).\n",

    "Naive Bayes classifiers are simple yet powerful algorithms for classification, especially when working with text data. Hereâ€™s a quick guide on when to use each type of Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: Use with continuous data where the features are normally distributed.\n",
    "- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: Ideal for text classification tasks where features are counts of words.\n",
    "- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**: Use with binary features (e.g., presence/absence of words in text classification).\n",
